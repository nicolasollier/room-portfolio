**A 2D Game as a Developer Portfolio**

While drawing inspiration from the innovative 3D developer portfolios out there, I've decided to take a different route by creating a 2D version. This serves as a customizable template for anyone looking to showcase their work in a unique, interactive manner. It's fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

**Installation**

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Building the Project

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the project and outputs it to a `dist` folder.

### Previewing the Build

For a local preview of the production build, execute:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deployment

After building the project, you can deploy it by uploading the contents of the `dist` folder to your preferred static site hosting service.
